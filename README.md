## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt the useage of:

- div element
- css flexbox

```html
<div class="qr-code">
  <div class="qr-coontainer">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="Qr image" />
  </div>
  <div class="texts">
    <div class="head-text">
      <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">
      <p>
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
        the next level
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #d6e1f0;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to dive deeper into flex and grid layout.

### Useful resources

- [MDN DEVELOPER](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) -
  I was able to understand the fundamentals of CSS FLEX through this MDN DOCS.

- [CSS TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This
  is an amazing article which helped me finally understand FLEXBOX LAYOUT. I'd
  recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
